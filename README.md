Collaborative navigation in unstructured environments using an aerial drone and a terrestrial robot
===

## Initial description

This project explores the collaboration between an aerial drone and a terrestrial robot for navigating unstructured
environments. The drone performs initial environmental mapping using sensors (e.g. GNSS, cameras...), generating a
topological map with identified paths, intersections, and potential targets. The terrestrial robot receives high-level
instructions (e.g., “reach a target”) and navigate using this topological map. It utilizes onboard sensors to match
environmental features previously detected with the drone and associated to the topological map.
