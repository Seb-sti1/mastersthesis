	abstract = {We address the problem of planning a path for a ground robot through unknown terrain, using observations from a flying robot. In search and rescue missions, which are our target scenarios, the time from arrival at the disaster site to the delivery of aid is critically important. Previous works required exhaustive exploration before path planning, which is time-consuming but eventually leads to an optimal path for the ground robot. Instead, we propose active exploration of the environment, where the flying robot chooses regions to map in a way that optimizes the overall response time of the system, which is the combined time for the air and ground robots to execute their missions. In our approach, we estimate terrain classes throughout our terrain map, and we also add elevation information in areas where the active exploration algorithm has chosen to perform 3-D reconstruction. This terrain information is used to estimate feasible and efficient paths for the ground robot. By exploring the environment actively, we achieve superior response times compared to both exhaustive and greedy exploration strategies. We demonstrate the performance and capabilities of the proposed system in simulated and real-world outdoor experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address ground robot path planning using active aerial exploration.},

A dense minimisation approach is employed which directly uses all grey-scale information available within the stereo pair (or stereo region) leading to very robust and precise results. Metric 3D structure constraints are imposed by consistently warping corresponding stereo images to generate novel viewpoints at each stereo acquisition. An iterative non-linear trajectory estimation approach is formulated based on a quadrifocal relationship between the image intensities within adjacent views of the stereo pair. A robust M-estimation technique is used to reject outliers corresponding to moving objects within the scene or other outliers such as occlusions and illumination changes. The technique is applied to recovering the trajectory of a moving vehicle in long and difficult sequences of images.},

This paper proposes a 2D topology map building method from the air view, which can be effectively used for global path planning of ground mobile robots. To realize the 3D reconstruction of the ground from the air view, the 3D Euclidean Signed Distance Field ({ESDF}) is constructed incrementally from the Truncated Signed Distance Field ({TSDF}). The {ESDF} map occupies a large storage space, which is inconvenient to transmit to ground robots. To solve this problem, a lighter topology map is constructed on the basis of the {ESDF} map. Since ground robots can only move in the 2D plane, the 2D topological map is generated at any height from the ground to represent the topological structure of the ground robots working environment. The experimental results on the dataset and simulation environment shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

	shorttitle = {Dual-{BEV} Nav},
	abstract = {Path planning with strong environmental adaptability plays a crucial role in robotic navigation in unstructured outdoor environments, especially in the case of low-quality location and map information. The path planning ability of a robot depends on the identification of the traversability of global and local ground areas. In real-world scenarios, the complexity of outdoor open environments makes it difficult for robots to identify the traversability of ground areas that lack a clearly defined structure. Moreover, most existing methods have rarely analyzed the integration of local and global traversability identifications in unstructured outdoor scenarios. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, Dual-{BEV} Nav, first introducing Bird’s Eye View ({BEV}) representations into local planning to generate high-quality traversable paths. Then, these paths are projected onto the global traversability map generated by the global {BEV} planning model to obtain the optimal waypoints. By integrating the traversability from both local and global {BEV}, we establish a dual-layer {BEV} heuristic planning paradigm, enabling long-distance navigation in unstructured outdoor environments. We test our approach through both public dataset evaluations and real-world robot deployments, yielding promising results. Compared to baselines, the {DualBEV} Nav improved temporal distance prediction accuracy by up to 18.7\%. In the real-world deployment, under conditions significantly different from the training set and with notable occlusions in the global {BEV}, the Dual-{BEV} Nav successfully achieved a 65-meter-long outdoor navigation. Further analysis demonstrates that the local {BEV} representation significantly enhances the rationality of the planning, while the global {BEV} probability map ensures the robustness of the overall planning.},

	abstract = {Terrain awareness is an essential milestone to enable truly autonomous off-road navigation. Accurately predicting terrain characteristics allows optimizing a vehicle's path against potential hazards. Recent methods use deep neural networks to predict traversability-related terrain properties in a self-supervised manner, relying on proprioception as a training signal. However, onboard cameras are inherently limited by their point-of-view relative to the ground, suffering from occlusions and vanishing pixel density with distance. This paper introduces a novel approach for self-supervised terrain characterization using an aerial perspective from a hovering drone. We capture terrain-aligned images while sampling the environment with a ground vehicle, effectively training a simple predictor for vibrations, bumpiness, and energy consumption. Our dataset includes 2.8 km of off-road data collected in forest environment, comprising 13 484 ground-based images and 12 935 aerial images. Our findings show that drone imagery improves terrain property prediction by 21.37 \% on the whole dataset and 37.35 \% in high vegetation, compared to ground robot images. We conduct ablation studies to identify the offline causes of these performance improvements. We also demonstrate the real-world applicability of our approach by scouting an unseen area with a drone, planning and executing an optimized path on the ground.},

The structural component analogously rewards hypotheses which correspond to empty or low-density regions in a groundstrike-ﬁltered ladar obstacle map.

	abstract = {Stereo vision is an attractive passive sensing technique for obtaining three-dimensional (3-D) measurements. Recent hardware advances have given rise to a new class of real-time dense disparity estimation algorithms. This paper examines their suitability for intelligent vehicle ({IV}) applications. In order to gain a better understanding of the performance and the computational-cost tradeoff, the authors created a framework of real-time implementations. This consists of different methodical components based on single instruction multiple data ({SIMD}) techniques. Furthermore, the resulting algorithmic variations are compared with other publicly available algorithms. The authors argue that existing publicly available stereo data sets are not very suitable for the {IV} domain. Therefore, the authors' evaluation of stereo algorithms is based on novel realistically looking simulated data as well as real data from complex urban traffic scenes. In order to facilitate future benchmarks, all data used in this paper is made publicly available. The results from this study reveal that there is a considerable influence of scene conditions on the performance of all tested algorithms. Approaches that aim for (global) search optimization are more affected by this than other approaches. The best overall performance is achieved by the proposed multiple-window algorithm, which uses local matching and a left-right check for a robust error rejection. Timing results show that the simplest of the proposed {SIMD} variants are more than twice as fast than the most complex one. Nevertheless, the latter still achieves real-time processing speeds, while their average accuracy is at least equal to that of publicly available non-{SIMD} algorithms},

	abstract = {Sensory perception for unmanned ground vehicle navigation has received great attention from the robotics community. However, sensors mounted on the vehicle are regularly viewpoint impaired. A vehicle navigating at high speeds in off- road environments may be unable to react to negative obstacles such as large holes and cliffs. One approach to address this problem is to complement the sensing capabilities of an unmanned ground vehicle with overhead data gathered from an aerial source. This paper presents techniques to achieve accurate terrain classiﬁcation by utilizing high-density, colorized, three- dimensional laser data. We describe methods to extract relevant features from this sensor data in such a way that a learning algorithm can successfully train on a small set of labeled data in order to classify a much larger map and show experimental results. Additionally, we introduce a technique to signiﬁcantly reduce classiﬁcation errors through the use of context. Finally, we show how this algorithm can be customized for the intended vehicle’s capabilities in order to create more accurate a priori maps that can then be used for path planning.},

The method is based on a modified Mumford-Shah model and it uses a two-stage curve evolution strategy to get a preferable detection. It applies fractal error metric, developed by Cooper, et al. (1994) at the first curve evolution stage and adds additional constraint texture edge descriptor that is defined by using {DCT} (discrete cosine transform) coefficients on the image at the next stage. Man-made objects and natural areas are optimally differentiated by evolving the partial differential equation. The method artfully avoids selecting a threshold to separate the fractal error image, while an improper threshold often results in great segmentation errors.

Qualitative and quantitative results computed on a large real-world dataset (which we provide for download) show that our approach outperforms alternatives, and yields an accuracy comparable to the accuracy of humans that are tested on the same image classification task.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a model for trail detection and tracking that builds upon the observation that trails are salient structures in the robot's visual field. Due to the complexity of natural environments, the straightforward application of bottom-up visual saliency models is not sufficiently robust to predict the location of trails. As for other detection tasks, robustness can be increased by modulating the saliency computation based on a priori knowledge about which pixel-wise visual features are most representative of the object being sought. This paper proposes the use of the object's overall layout as the primary cue instead, as it is more stable and predictable in natural trails. Bearing in mind computational parsimony and detection robustness, this knowledge is specified in terms of perception-action rules, which control the behavior of simple agents performing as a swarm to compute the saliency map of the input image. For the purpose of tracking, multiframe evidence about the trail location is obtained with a motion-compensated dynamic neural field. In addition, to reduce ambiguity between the trail and trail-like distractors, a simple appearance model is learned online and used to influence the agents' activity. Experimental results on a large data set reveal the ability of the model to produce a success rate on the order of 97\% at 20 Hz. The model is shown to be robust in situations where previous models would fail, such as when the trail does not emerge from the lower part of the image or when it is considerably interrupted. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The core of the new method is incorporating the topology information of the surveyed 3D structure to decompose the multi-view stereo path planning into a collection of overlapped view optimization problems that can be processed in parallel. Different from the existing state-of-the-arts that recursively select the vantage camera views, the new method iteratively resamples all nearby cameras (i.e., positions/orientations) together and achieves a substantial reduction in computation cost while improving reconstruction quality. The new approach also provides a higher-level automation function that facilitates field implementations by eliminating the need for redundant camera initialization as in existing studies. Validations are provided by measuring the variance between the reconstructions to the ground truth models. Results from three synthetic case studies and one real-world application are presented to demonstrate the improved performance. The new method is expected to be instrumental in expanding the adoption of {UAV}-based multi-view stereo 3D reconstruction of large and complex structures.},

Several such approaches have been proposed in the literature from {PointConstrast} [40], which uses a contrast at the level of points, to the state-of-the-art {TARL} [30], which uses a contrast at the level of segments, roughly corresponding to objects. While the former enjoys a great simplicity of implementation, it is surpassed by the latter, which however requires a costly pre-processing. In {BEVContrast}, we define our contrast at the level of 2D cells in the Bird’s Eye View plane. Resulting cell-level representations offer a good trade-off between the point-level representations exploited in {PointContrast} and segment-level representations exploited in {TARL}: we retain the simplicity of {PointContrast} (cell representations are cheap to compute) while surpassing the performance of {TARL} in downstream semantic segmentation.

We propose a new end-to-end architecture that directly extracts a bird’s-eye-view representation of a scene given image data from an arbitrary number of cameras. The core idea behind our approach is to “lift” each image individually into a frustum of features for each camera, then “splat” all frustums into a rasterized bird’s-eyeview grid. By training on the entire camera rig, we provide evidence that our model is able to learn not only how to represent images but how to fuse predictions from all cameras into a single cohesive representation of the scene while being robust to calibration error. On standard bird’seye-view tasks such as object segmentation and map segmentation, our model outperforms all baselines and prior work. In pursuit of the goal of learning dense representations for motion planning, we show that the representations inferred by our model enable interpretable end-to-end motion planning by “shooting” template trajectories into a bird’s-eyeview cost map output by our network. We benchmark our approach against models that use oracle depth from lidar. Project page with code: https://nv-tlabs.github.io/lift-splat-shoot.},

	abstract = {Robotic navigation has been approached as a problem of 3D reconstruction and planning, as well as an end-to-end learning problem. However, long-range navigation requires both planning and reasoning about local traversability, as well as being able to utilize general knowledge about global geography, in the form of a roadmap, {GPS}, or other side information providing important cues. In this work, we propose an approach that integrates learning and planning, and can utilize side information such as schematic roadmaps, satellite maps and {GPS} coordinates as a planning heuristic, without relying on them being accurate. Our method, {ViKiNG}, incorporates a local traversability model, which looks at the robot's current camera observation and a potential subgoal to infer how easily that subgoal can be reached, as well as a heuristic model, which looks at overhead maps for hints and attempts to evaluate the appropriateness of these subgoals in order to reach the goal. These models are used by a heuristic planner to identify the best waypoint in order to reach the final destination. Our method performs no explicit geometric reconstruction, utilizing only a topological representation of the environment. Despite having never seen trajectories longer than 80 meters in its training dataset, {ViKiNG} can leverage its image-based learned controller and goal-directed heuristic to navigate to goals up to 3 kilometers away in previously unseen environments, and exhibit complex behaviors such as probing potential paths and backtracking when they are found to be non-viable. {ViKiNG} is also robust to unreliable maps and {GPS}, since the low-level controller ultimately makes decisions based on egocentric image observations, using maps only as planning heuristics.

The incremental method can be adapted to any fundamental Voronoi diagram generator. We maintain the entire space by two graphs, the pruned Voronoi graph for incremental updates and the reduced approximated generalized Voronoi graph for routing planning requests. We present an extensive benchmark and real-world experiment, and our method completes the environment representation in both indoor and outdoor areas. The proposed method generates a compact topological map in both small- and large-scale scenarios, which is defined as the total length and vertices of topological maps. Additionally, our method has been shortened by several orders of magnitude in terms of the total length and consumes less than 30\% of the average time cost compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are constantly being using in professional activities that require higher precision in navigating and positioning the aircraft during operation. Advanced location technologies such as Global Navigation Satellite System and Real-Time Kinematic are widely used, however, they depend on an area with transmission coverage. In this approach, this article presents a visual navigation methodology based on topological maps. We compared the performance of consolidated classifiers such as Bayesian classifier, k-nearest neighbor, Multilayer Perceptron, Optimal Path Forest and Support Vector Machines ({SVM}). They are evaluated with attributes returned by last generation resource extractors such as Fourier, Gray Level Co-Occurrence and Local Binary Patterns ({LBP}). After analyzing the results we found that the combination of {LBP} and {SVM} obtained the best values in the evaluation metrics considered, among them, 99.99\% Specificity and 99.98\% Precision in the navigation process. {SVM} reached 5.49787 s in combination with {LBP} completes the training in 5.49787 s. Concerning the testing time, {SVM} achieving 80.91 ms in association with {LBP}.},

	abstract = {There are many outdoor robotic applications where a robot must reach a goal position or explore an area without previous knowledge of the environment around it. Additionally, other applications (like path planning) require the use of known maps or previous information of the environment. This work presents a system composed by a terrestrial and an aerial robot that cooperate and share sensor information in order to address those requirements. The ground robot is able to navigate in an unknown large environment aided by visual feedback from a camera on board the aerial robot. At the same time, the obstacles are mapped in real-time by putting together the information from the camera and the positioning system of the ground robot. A set of experiments were carried out with the purpose of verifying the system applicability. The experiments were performed in a simulation environment and outdoor with a medium-sized ground robot and a mini quad-rotor. The proposed robotic system shows outstanding results in simultaneous navigation and mapping applications in large outdoor environments.},
