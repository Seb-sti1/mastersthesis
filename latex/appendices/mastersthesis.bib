	abstract = {We address the problem of planning a path for a ground robot through unknown terrain, using observations from a flying robot. In search and rescue missions, which are our target scenarios, the time from arrival at the disaster site to the delivery of aid is critically important. Previous works required exhaustive exploration before path planning, which is time-consuming but eventually leads to an optimal path for the ground robot. Instead, we propose active exploration of the environment, where the flying robot chooses regions to map in a way that optimizes the overall response time of the system, which is the combined time for the air and ground robots to execute their missions. In our approach, we estimate terrain classes throughout our terrain map, and we also add elevation information in areas where the active exploration algorithm has chosen to perform 3-D reconstruction. This terrain information is used to estimate feasible and efficient paths for the ground robot. By exploring the environment actively, we achieve superior response times compared to both exhaustive and greedy exploration strategies. We demonstrate the performance and capabilities of the proposed system in simulated and real-world outdoor experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address ground robot path planning using active aerial exploration.},

A dense minimisation approach is employed which directly uses all grey-scale information available within the stereo pair (or stereo region) leading to very robust and precise results. Metric 3D structure constraints are imposed by consistently warping corresponding stereo images to generate novel viewpoints at each stereo acquisition. An iterative non-linear trajectory estimation approach is formulated based on a quadrifocal relationship between the image intensities within adjacent views of the stereo pair. A robust M-estimation technique is used to reject outliers corresponding to moving objects within the scene or other outliers such as occlusions and illumination changes. The technique is applied to recovering the trajectory of a moving vehicle in long and difficult sequences of images.},

This paper proposes a 2D topology map building method from the air view, which can be effectively used for global path planning of ground mobile robots. To realize the 3D reconstruction of the ground from the air view, the 3D Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) is constructed incrementally from the Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF). The ESDF map occupies a large storage space, which is inconvenient to transmit to ground robots. To solve this problem, a lighter topology map is constructed on the basis of the ESDF map. Since ground robots can only move in the 2D plane, the 2D topological map is generated at any height from the ground to represent the topological structure of the ground robots working environment. The experimental results on the dataset and simulation environment shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Path planning with strong environmental adaptability plays a crucial role in robotic navigation in unstructured outdoor environments, especially in the case of low-quality location and map information. The path planning ability of a robot depends on the identification of the traversability of global and local ground areas. In real-world scenarios, the complexity of outdoor open environments makes it difficult for robots to identify the traversability of ground areas that lack a clearly defined structure. Moreover, most existing methods have rarely analyzed the integration of local and global traversability identifications in unstructured outdoor scenarios. To address this problem, we propose a novel method, Dual-BEV Nav, first introducing Bird’s Eye View (BEV) representations into local planning to generate high-quality traversable paths. Then, these paths are projected onto the global traversability map generated by the global BEV planning model to obtain the optimal waypoints. By integrating the traversability from both local and global BEV, we establish a dual-layer BEV heuristic planning paradigm, enabling long-distance navigation in unstructured outdoor environments. We test our approach through both public dataset evaluations and real-world robot deployments, yielding promising results. Compared to baselines, the DualBEV Nav improved temporal distance prediction accuracy by up to 18.7\%. In the real-world deployment, under conditions significantly different from the training set and with notable occlusions in the global BEV, the Dual-BEV Nav successfully achieved a 65-meter-long outdoor navigation. Further analysis demonstrates that the local BEV representation significantly enhances the rationality of the planning, while the global BEV probability map ensures the robustness of the overall planning.},

	abstract = {Terrain awareness is an essential milestone to enable truly autonomous off-road navigation. Accurately predicting terrain characteristics allows optimizing a vehicle's path against potential hazards. Recent methods use deep neural networks to predict traversability-related terrain properties in a self-supervised manner, relying on proprioception as a training signal. However, onboard cameras are inherently limited by their point-of-view relative to the ground, suffering from occlusions and vanishing pixel density with distance. This paper introduces a novel approach for self-supervised terrain characterization using an aerial perspective from a hovering drone. We capture terrain-aligned images while sampling the environment with a ground vehicle, effectively training a simple predictor for vibrations, bumpiness, and energy consumption. Our dataset includes 2.8 km of off-road data collected in forest environment, comprising 13 484 ground-based images and 12 935 aerial images. Our findings show that drone imagery improves terrain property prediction by 21.37 \% on the whole dataset and 37.35 \% in high vegetation, compared to ground robot images. We conduct ablation studies to identify the main causes of these performance improvements. We also demonstrate the real-world applicability of our approach by scouting an unseen area with a drone, planning and executing an optimized path on the ground.},

It generates region hypotheses from a learned distribution of expected trail width and curvature variation, and scores them using a robust measure of color and brightness contrast with ﬂanking regions. The structural component analogously rewards hypotheses which correspond to empty or low-density regions in a groundstrike-ﬁltered ladar obstacle map. Our system’s performance is analyzed on several long sequences with diverse appearance and structural characteristics.

	abstract = {Stereo vision is an attractive passive sensing technique for obtaining three-dimensional (3-D) measurements. Recent hardware advances have given rise to a new class of real-time dense disparity estimation algorithms. This paper examines their suitability for intelligent vehicle (IV) applications. In order to gain a better understanding of the performance and the computational-cost tradeoff, the authors created a framework of real-time implementations. This consists of different methodical components based on single instruction multiple data (SIMD) techniques. Furthermore, the resulting algorithmic variations are compared with other publicly available algorithms. The authors argue that existing publicly available stereo data sets are not very suitable for the IV domain. Therefore, the authors' evaluation of stereo algorithms is based on novel realistically looking simulated data as well as real data from complex urban traffic scenes. In order to facilitate future benchmarks, all data used in this paper is made publicly available. The results from this study reveal that there is a considerable influence of scene conditions on the performance of all tested algorithms. Approaches that aim for (global) search optimization are more affected by this than other approaches. The best overall performance is achieved by the proposed multiple-window algorithm, which uses local matching and a left-right check for a robust error rejection. Timing results show that the simplest of the proposed SIMD variants are more than twice as fast than the most complex one. Nevertheless, the latter still achieves real-time processing speeds, while their average accuracy is at least equal to that of publicly available non-SIMD algorithms},

	abstract = {Sensory perception for unmanned ground vehicle navigation has received great attention from the robotics community. However, sensors mounted on the vehicle are regularly viewpoint impaired. A vehicle navigating at high speeds in off- road environments may be unable to react to negative obstacles such as large holes and cliffs. One approach to address this problem is to complement the sensing capabilities of an unmanned ground vehicle with overhead data gathered from an aerial source. This paper presents techniques to achieve accurate terrain classiﬁcation by utilizing high-density, colorized, three- dimensional laser data. We describe methods to extract relevant features from this sensor data in such a way that a learning algorithm can successfully train on a small set of labeled data in order to classify a much larger map and show experimental results. Additionally, we introduce a technique to signiﬁcantly reduce classiﬁcation errors through the use of context. Finally, we show how this algorithm can be customized for the intended vehicle’s capabilities in order to create more accurate a priori maps that can then be used for path planning.},

The method is based on a modified Mumford-Shah model and it uses a two-stage curve evolution strategy to get a preferable detection. It applies fractal error metric, developed by Cooper, et al. (1994) at the first curve evolution stage and adds additional constraint texture edge descriptor that is defined by using DCT (discrete cosine transform) coefficients on the image at the next stage. Man-made objects and natural areas are optimally differentiated by evolving the partial differential equation. The method artfully avoids selecting a threshold to separate the fractal error image, while an improper threshold often results in great segmentation errors. Experiments of the segmentation show that the proposed method is efficient.},

Qualitative and quantitative results computed on a large real-world dataset (which we provide for download) show that our approach outperforms alternatives, and yields an accuracy comparable to the accuracy of humans that are tested on the same image classification task.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a model for trail detection and tracking that builds upon the observation that trails are salient structures in the robot's visual field. Due to the complexity of natural environments, the straightforward application of bottom-up visual saliency models is not sufficiently robust to predict the location of trails. As for other detection tasks, robustness can be increased by modulating the saliency computation based on a priori knowledge about which pixel-wise visual features are most representative of the object being sought. This paper proposes the use of the object's overall layout as the primary cue instead, as it is more stable and predictable in natural trails. Bearing in mind computational parsimony and detection robustness, this knowledge is specified in terms of perception-action rules, which control the behavior of simple agents performing as a swarm to compute the saliency map of the input image. For the purpose of tracking, multiframe evidence about the trail location is obtained with a motion-compensated dynamic neural field. In addition, to reduce ambiguity between the trail and trail-like distractors, a simple appearance model is learned online and used to influence the agents' activity. Experimental results on a large data set reveal the ability of the model to produce a success rate on the order of 97\% at 20 Hz. The model is shown to be robust in situations where previous models would fail, such as when the trail does not emerge from the lower part of the image or when it is considerably interrupted. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The core of the new method is incorporating the topology information of the surveyed 3D structure to decompose the multi-view stereo path planning into a collection of overlapped view optimization problems that can be processed in parallel. Different from the existing state-of-the-arts that recursively select the vantage camera views, the new method iteratively resamples all nearby cameras (i.e., positions/orientations) together and achieves a substantial reduction in computation cost while improving reconstruction quality. The new approach also provides a higher-level automation function that facilitates field implementations by eliminating the need for redundant camera initialization as in existing studies. Validations are provided by measuring the variance between the reconstructions to the ground truth models. Results from three synthetic case studies and one real-world application are presented to demonstrate the improved performance. The new method is expected to be instrumental in expanding the adoption of UAV-based multi-view stereo 3D reconstruction of large and complex structures.},

We design a contrastive loss between features of Lidar scans captured in the same scene. Several such approaches have been proposed in the literature from PointConstrast [40], which uses a contrast at the level of points, to the state-of-the-art TARL [30], which uses a contrast at the level of segments, roughly corresponding to objects. While the former enjoys a great simplicity of implementation, it is surpassed by the latter, which however requires a costly pre-processing. In BEVContrast, we define our contrast at the level of 2D cells in the Bird’s Eye View plane. Resulting cell-level representations offer a good trade-off between the point-level representations exploited in PointContrast and segment-level representations exploited in TARL: we retain the simplicity of PointContrast (cell representations are cheap to compute) while surpassing the performance of TARL in downstream semantic segmentation.

In this paper, we build on a recent hash-based technique for large-scale fusion and an efficient mean-field inference algorithm for densely-connected CRFs to present what to our knowledge is the first system that can perform dense, large-scale, outdoor semantic reconstruction of a scene in (near) real time. We also present a 'semantic fusion' approach that allows us to handle dynamic objects more effectively than previous approaches.

We propose a new end-to-end architecture that directly extracts a bird’s-eye-view representation of a scene given image data from an arbitrary number of cameras. The core idea behind our approach is to “lift” each image individually into a frustum of features for each camera, then “splat” all frustums into a rasterized bird’s-eyeview grid. By training on the entire camera rig, we provide evidence that our model is able to learn not only how to represent images but how to fuse predictions from all cameras into a single cohesive representation of the scene while being robust to calibration error. On standard bird’seye-view tasks such as object segmentation and map segmentation, our model outperforms all baselines and prior work. In pursuit of the goal of learning dense representations for motion planning, we show that the representations inferred by our model enable interpretable end-to-end motion planning by “shooting” template trajectories into a bird’s-eyeview cost map output by our network. We benchmark our approach against models that use oracle depth from lidar. Project page with code: https://nv-tlabs.github.io/lift-splat-shoot.},

	abstract = {Robotic navigation has been approached as a problem of 3D reconstruction and planning, as well as an end-to-end learning problem. However, long-range navigation requires both planning and reasoning about local traversability, as well as being able to utilize general knowledge about global geography, in the form of a roadmap, GPS, or other side information providing important cues. In this work, we propose an approach that integrates learning and planning, and can utilize side information such as schematic roadmaps, satellite maps and GPS coordinates as a planning heuristic, without relying on them being accurate. Our method, ViKiNG, incorporates a local traversability model, which looks at the robot's current camera observation and a potential subgoal to infer how easily that subgoal can be reached, as well as a heuristic model, which looks at overhead maps for hints and attempts to evaluate the appropriateness of these subgoals in order to reach the goal. These models are used by a heuristic planner to identify the best waypoint in order to reach the final destination. Our method performs no explicit geometric reconstruction, utilizing only a topological representation of the environment. Despite having never seen trajectories longer than 80 meters in its training dataset, ViKiNG can leverage its image-based learned controller and goal-directed heuristic to navigate to goals up to 3 kilometers away in previously unseen environments, and exhibit complex behaviors such as probing potential paths and backtracking when they are found to be non-viable. ViKiNG is also robust to unreliable maps and GPS, since the low-level controller ultimately makes decisions based on egocentric image observations, using maps only as planning heuristics.

The incremental method can be adapted to any fundamental Voronoi diagram generator. We maintain the entire space by two graphs, the pruned Voronoi graph for incremental updates and the reduced approximated generalized Voronoi graph for routing planning requests.

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are constantly being using in professional activities that require higher precision in navigating and positioning the aircraft during operation. Advanced location technologies such as Global Navigation Satellite System and Real-Time Kinematic are widely used, however, they depend on an area with transmission coverage. In this approach, this article presents a visual navigation methodology based on topological maps. We compared the performance of consolidated classifiers such as Bayesian classifier, k-nearest neighbor, Multilayer Perceptron, Optimal Path Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM). They are evaluated with attributes returned by last generation resource extractors such as Fourier, Gray Level Co-Occurrence and Local Binary Patterns (LBP). After analyzing the results we found that the combination of LBP and SVM obtained the best values in the evaluation metrics considered, among them, 99.99\% Specificity and 99.98\% Precision in the navigation process. SVM reached 5.49787 s in combination with LBP completes the training in 5.49787 s. Concerning the testing time, SVM achieving 80.91 ms in association with LBP.},

This work presents a system composed by a terrestrial and an aerial robot that cooperate and share sensor information in order to address those requirements. The ground robot is able to navigate in an unknown large environment aided by visual feedback from a camera on board the aerial robot. At the same time, the obstacles are mapped in real-time by putting together the information from the camera and the positioning system of the ground robot. A set of experiments were carried out with the purpose of verifying the system applicability. The experiments were performed in a simulation environment and outdoor with a medium-sized ground robot and a mini quad-rotor. The proposed robotic system shows outstanding results in simultaneous navigation and mapping applications in large outdoor environments.},

Our system uses a vision-based ﬂying robot to guide a ground robot through unknown terrain to a goal location by building a map of terrain class and elevation. However, due to the unknown environments present in search and rescue scenarios, our system requires a terrain classiﬁer that can be trained and deployed quickly, based on data collected on the spot. We investigate the relationship of training set size and complexity on training time and accuracy, for both feature-based and convolutional neural network classiﬁers in this scenario. Our goal is to minimize the deployment time of the classiﬁer in our terrain mapping system within acceptable classiﬁcation accuracy tolerances. So we are not concerned with training a classiﬁer that generalizes well, only one that works well for this particular environment. We demonstrate that we can launch our aerial robot, gather data, train a classiﬁer, and begin building a terrain map after only 60 seconds of ﬂight.},

	abstract = {To address the challenge of autonomous UGV localization in GNSS-denied off-road environments, this study proposes a matching-based localization method that leverages BEV perception image and satellite map within a road similarity space to achieve high-precision positioning.We first implement a robust LiDAR-inertial odometry system, followed by the fusion of LiDAR and image data to generate a local BEV perception image of the UGV. This approach mitigates the significant viewpoint discrepancy between ground-view images and satellite map. The BEV image and satellite map are then projected into the road similarity space, where normalized cross correlation (NCC) is computed to assess the matching score.Finally, a particle filter is employed to estimate the probability distribution of the vehicle’s pose.By comparing with GNSS ground truth, our localization system demonstrated stability without divergence over a long-distance test of 10 km, achieving an average lateral error of only 0.89 meters and an average planar Euclidean error of 3.41 meters. Furthermore, it maintained accurate and stable global localization even under nighttime conditions, further validating its robustness and adaptability.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2506.05250},
	abstract = {Robust cross-view 3-DoF localization in GPS-denied, off-road environments remains a fundamental challenge due to two key factors: (1) perceptual ambiguities arising from repetitive vegetation and unstructured terrain that lack distinctive visual features, and (2) seasonal appearance shifts that alter scene characteristics well beyond chromatic variation, making it difficult to match current ground-view observations to outdated satellite imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce MoViX, a selfsupervised cross-view video localization framework that learns representations robust to viewpoint and seasonal variation, while preserving directional awareness critical for accurate localization. MoViX employs a pose-dependent positive sampling strategy to enhance directional discrimination and temporally aligned hard negative mining to discourage shortcut learning from seasonal appearance cues. A motion-informed frame sampler selects spatially diverse video frames, and a lightweight, quality-aware temporal aggregator prioritizes frames with strong geometric alignment while downweighting ambiguous ones. At inference, MoViX operates within a Monte Carlo Localization framework, replacing traditional handcrafted measurement models with a learned cross-view neural matching module. Belief updates are modulated through entropy-guided temperature scaling, allowing the filter to maintain multiple pose hypotheses under visual ambiguity and converge confidently when reliable evidence is observed. We evaluate MoViX on the TartanDrive 2.0 dataset, training on less than 30 minutes of driving data and testing over 12.29 km of trajectories. Despite using temporally mismatched satellite imagery, MoViX localizes within 25 meters of ground truth for 93\% of the time and within 50 meters for 100\% in unseen regions, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without environment-specific tuning. We also showcase its generalization on a real-world off-road dataset collected in a geographically distinct location with a different robot platform. The code will be made publicly available upon publication. A demonstration video is available at: https://youtu.be/y5wL8nUEuH0.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks.

The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model, prior to shape inspection. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The image matching field has been witnessing a continuous emergence of novel learnable feature matching techniques, with ever-improving performance on conventional benchmarks. However, our investigation shows that despite these gains, their potential for real-world applications is restricted by their limited generalization capabilities to novel image domains. In this paper, we introduce OmniGlue, the first learnable image matcher that is designed with generalization as a core principle. OmniGlue leverages broad knowledge from a vision foundation model to guide the feature matching process, boosting generalization to domains not seen at training time. Additionally, we propose a novel keypoint position-guided attention mechanism which disentangles spatial and appearance information, leading to enhanced matching descriptors. We perform comprehensive experiments on a suite of \$7\$ datasets with varied image domains, including scene-level, object-centric and aerial images. OmniGlue's novel components lead to relative gains on unseen domains of \$20.9{\textbackslash}\%\$ with respect to a directly comparable reference model, while also outperforming the recent LightGlue method by \$9.5{\textbackslash}\%\$ relatively.Code and model can be found at https://hwjiang1510.github.io/OmniGlue},

	abstract = {We introduce a lightweight and accurate architecture for resource-efficient visual correspondence. Our method, dubbed XFeat (Accelerated Features), revisits fundamental design choices in convolutional neural networks for detecting, extracting, and matching local features. Our new model satisfies a critical need for fast and robust algorithms suitable to resource-limited devices. In particular, accurate image matching requires sufficiently large image resolutions - for this reason, we keep the resolution as large as possible while limiting the number of channels in the network. Besides, our model is designed to offer the choice of matching at the sparse or semi-dense levels, each of which may be more suitable for different downstream applications, such as visual navigation and augmented reality. Our model is the first to offer semi-dense matching efficiently, leveraging a novel match refinement module that relies on coarse local descriptors. XFeat is versatile and hardware-independent, surpassing current deep learning-based local features in speed (up to 5x faster) with comparable or better accuracy, proven in pose estimation and visual localization. We showcase it running in real-time on an inexpensive laptop CPU without specialized hardware optimizations. Code and weights are available at www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/descriptors/xfeat\_cvpr24.},
